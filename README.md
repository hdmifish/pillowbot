# Pillowbot Readme
## Written by Punk, Alien, and iso. *but mainly iso* 


Pillow bot is a listener assistant bot written for Discord. 

Discord.py is dependant on python 3.4.1+ Python3.5 works great though. 

It can be downloaded here [python3.5.0 tarball] (https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.0/Python-3.5.0.tgz) 

Discord.py by Rapptz can be downloaded [here] (https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py)

__NOTE: To effectively install discord.py I had to use pip3.5 install instead of pip install __



Im still learning github. So there may be a clusterfuck of pulls and stuff. Please bear with me.
